#CODE2040 API Challenge

#About

This repository contains the solution of each stage in the CODE2040 API Challenge. I used Python to code the programs.

#Experience

I had seen http requests and JSON dictionary but never together. Before the challenge I had no idea that I could send a dictionary through http. I had to read some documentations to complete the stages and I learned things that helped me in the process. Also it was my first time dealing with date and time and it was nice. Sincerely I enjoyed the experience.
